# JavaScript Practice Problems

To start, you will need to install the jest package. This can easily be done by enxuring you are in the `/javascript` directory and then running `npm install`, which should automatically install the package for you.

You can make any changes to your application then run the command `npx jest`, which will find all the tests located in the `*.test.js` files and run them. Before you begin your edits, all tests should be passing. As you make modifications, continually test to check that your tests confirm you assumptions. Once you have completed your changes, be sure to run the `jest` command again to ensure they are all still working.
