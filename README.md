# practice-questions

A series of practice questions (and answers) for developers.

## Using this repository

The repository contains two branches, `questions`, and `answers`. You should start your work on the `questions` branch (or more properly a branch of `questions`), then compare your answers to the answers found on the `answers` branch. Avoid changing to the `answers` branch before you have at least submitted a solution where all tests pass.

The `answers` branch contains the "ideal" branch according to the author. Programming is not a black-and-white process, there are many different opinions and conventions that can change based on the language, team, and many other factors. So while the intent is to give you a good example, don't take it as a hard and fast truth.
